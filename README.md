# Fichenn

Fichenn is a standalone binary - written in Golang - for uploading and downloading secured files.

It aims to be portable and have a straightforward stream implementation (no fancy customisation based on third libraries like cURL and OpenSSL). The drawback is that you need to install this binary on both source and destination operating system.

## Usage

```
[~]>> finn -h
Fichenn secured uploads

Usage:
  finn [flags]

Flags:
  -c, --chmod+x         perform `chmod +x' on downloaded file
  -x, --extract         Tarball extract
  -h, --help            help for finn
  -o, --output string   write output to given destination
  -p, --pass string     passphrase used to decrypt
  -v, --version         version for finn
```

```

### Web Finn

This service does the same actions as the CLI but in WASM, in the web browser.

This service have to proxify all the traffic to the datastore in order to comply with web browsers security.

> The data upload and downloaded are not readable by the proxy since it's encrypted/decrypted in the web browser.

## How does it work?

- Upload stream workflow

```
file -> zstd -> age-encryption.org/v1 -> storage-server
```
```
directory -> tarball -> zstd -> age-encryption.org/v1 -> storage-server
```

- Download stream workflow

```
storage-server -> age-encryption.org/v1 -> zstd -> file
```
```
storage-server -> age-encryption.org/v1 -> zstd -> tarball -> directory
```

> - Compressed with Zstandard algorithm
> - Stream chunked encryption scheme with [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age)
